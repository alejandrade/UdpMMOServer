# UdpMMOServer

**UdpMmoServer** is a backend server built with Java 21, Spring Boot, and Gradle, designed to support real-time multiplayer networking over UDP. It is ideal for building large-scale online games, inspired by architectures used in MMORPGs like *World of Warcraft*.

This is a **passion project by ShroudedApp LLC**, created to help video game developers - indie or professional - build their own massively multiplayer online role-playing games. UdpMmoServer provides a scalable, extensible backend foundation focused on player state management, networking, and performance.
